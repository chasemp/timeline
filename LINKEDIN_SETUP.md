# LinkedIn Integration Setup

This guide explains how to integrate LinkedIn content into your timeline using the **manual export method**.

**Note:** This integration uses LinkedIn's data export feature rather than API access, providing comprehensive access to your LinkedIn activity including articles, publications, recommendations, and professional engagement data.

## Getting Your LinkedIn Data Export

### 1. Request Data Export

1. Go to https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/download-my-data
2. Sign in to your LinkedIn account
3. Click **"Request archive"**
4. Select **"Complete archive"** (includes all data)
5. Click **"Request archive"**
6. LinkedIn will email you when the export is ready (usually within 24 hours)

### 2. Download and Extract

1. Check your email for the LinkedIn export notification
2. Click the download link in the email
3. Download the ZIP file (usually named `Complete_LinkedInDataExport_YYYY-MM-DD.zip`)
4. Extract the ZIP file to a temporary location

## Processing the Export

### 1. Review Export Contents

The LinkedIn export contains many files. Key files for timeline integration:

- **`Articles/Articles/`** - Your published LinkedIn articles (HTML format)
- **`Publications.csv`** - Your publications and contributions
- **`Recommendations_Given.csv`** - Recommendations you've written
- **`Recommendations_Received.csv`** - Recommendations you've received
- **`InstantReposts.csv`** - Content you've reshared (optional)
- **`Positions.csv`** - Your work history (excluded from timeline)
- **`Projects.csv`** - Your projects (excluded from timeline)
- **`Certifications.csv`** - Your certifications (excluded from timeline)

### 2. Extract Content for Timeline

#### LinkedIn Articles
1. Navigate to `Articles/Articles/` in the export
2. Review the HTML files (your published articles)
3. Extract content and create timeline entries in `markdown/` directory
4. Use frontmatter format:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Article Title"
   excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->"
   categories:
     - Written
   tags:
     - LinkedIn Post
     - [topic tags]
   ---
   ```

#### Publications
1. Review `Publications.csv` for major publications
2. Create timeline entries for significant contributions
3. Use categories: `Written` or `Contributed`
4. Add tag: `Publications`

#### Professional Recommendations
1. Review `Recommendations_Given.csv` for recommendations you've written
2. Review `Recommendations_Received.csv` for recommendations you've received
3. Create individual timeline entries for each recommendation
4. Use categories: `Written` (given) or `Read` (received)
5. Add tags: `Recommend`/`Recommended`, `LinkedIn`

#### Reshared Content (Optional)
1. Review `InstantReposts.csv` for content you've shared
2. Create summary entries for posting activity (if desired)
3. Use category: `Posted`
4. Add tags: `LinkedIn`, `Content Curation`

## File Organization

### Timeline Structure
```
markdown/
├── YYYY-MM-DD-linkedin-article-title.md           # LinkedIn articles
├── YYYY-MM-DD-publication-title.md                # Major publications

```

### Naming Convention
- Use date format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for titles

## Content Processing Workflow

### 1. Initial Review
1. Extract the LinkedIn export ZIP file
2. Review `Articles/Articles/` for published content
3. Review `Publications.csv` for major contributions
4. Review `Recommendations_Given.csv` and `Recommendations_Received.csv` for professional recommendations
5. Review `InstantReposts.csv` for sharing activity (optional)

### 2. Content Extraction
1. **Articles**: Convert HTML to Markdown, preserve formatting
2. **Publications**: Extract key details, create summary entries
3. **Recommendations**: Create individual entries for each recommendation with proper timestamps
4. **Reshared**: Create activity summary with timeline (optional)

### 3. Timeline Integration
1. Create markdown files in `markdown/` directory
2. Use proper frontmatter with categories and tags
3. Include `<!--more-->` separator for excerpts
4. Test timeline display

## Data Privacy Considerations

### Sensitive Data
The LinkedIn export contains sensitive personal information:
- **Messages**: Personal conversations (exclude from timeline)
- **Email Addresses**: Personal contact info (exclude)
- **Phone Numbers**: Personal contact info (exclude)
- **Connections**: Professional network (exclude)

### Public Content Only
Only include content that was already public on LinkedIn:
- Published articles
- Public posts and shares
- Professional publications
- Public profile information

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- LinkedIn exports are point-in-time snapshots
- Request new exports periodically (quarterly/yearly)
- Review new content for timeline inclusion
- Update existing entries if needed

### Content Review
- Periodically review timeline entries for relevance
- Remove outdated or less relevant content
- Update tags and categories as needed
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Export Issues
- **Export not received**: Check spam folder, request again
- **Incomplete export**: Request complete archive, not partial
- **Corrupted files**: Re-download from LinkedIn

### Content Processing
- **HTML formatting**: Use proper Markdown conversion
- **Character encoding**: Ensure UTF-8 encoding
- **Image references**: Update image paths to local assets
- **Link validation**: Check external links are accessible
