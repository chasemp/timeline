# ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE ⚠️
#
# This file is REQUIRED for GitHub Pages to work correctly.
#
# WHY: GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which ignores directories
# starting with underscores (like _astro/). Without this file, all
# CSS and JS files in _astro/ will return 404 errors, causing the
# site to load without any styling.
#
# SYMPTOM: If this file is missing, the site will appear broken with
# no CSS styling - cards will be plain, no timeline dots/spine, etc.
#
# This file tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing and serve
# all files directly, including _astro/*.css and _astro/*.js files.
