Proper use of scores requires drilling into underlying states and measuring rates and change. He urges cyber education to teach principled measurement and decision thinking, not just fleeting tools.",

    "summary": "Ethereum is a blockchain platform that expands on Bitcoin's decentralized digital currency concept by introducing a proof of work-based blockchain for public transaction agreement. It aims to facilitate smart contracts, digital assets, decentralized exchange, and more through a Turing-complete programming language embedded in the blockchain. Ethereum's system of accounts and code execution enables a wide range of applications, from financial derivatives to decentralized governance. By merging scripting, altcoins, and meta-protocols, Ethereum provides a versatile framework for creating consensus-based applications with enhanced scalability and interoperability.",
