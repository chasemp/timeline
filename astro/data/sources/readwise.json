    "summary": "Approximately 212 RFCs use the terms 'foo', 'bar', or 'foobar' without clear explanations. The etymology of 'foo' traces back to prewar comic strips and cartoons, with various theories about its origins. The term 'foobar' likely spread among early computer engineers due to its resemblance to 'FUBAR' and its parsing in electronics techspeak.",

    "summary": "The term REST has been widely misused in the computer programming industry, with many people referring to any HTTP-based interface as a REST API. However, the true meaning of REST is centered around the concept of hypertext as a constraint. In order to be considered RESTful, an API must be driven by hypertext, with the API information necessary for interaction contained within the response itself. Unfortunately, most JSON APIs fall short of meeting this requirement, as they lack the self-describing nature of hypertext. Despite this, the term REST has stuck and is often used to describe APIs that are not truly RESTful.",

Each agent's actions are recorded in a secure, append-only chain, ensuring accountability and data integrity within applications.

It introduces a new approach through a story about the Players of Ludos, who found that starting with common ground rules allowed for better coordination without the need for a single agreed-upon state. The author argues for moving from seeking global consensus to scaling consent, enabling efficient collaboration in dynamic environments.",
