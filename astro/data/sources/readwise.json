Its culture resisted change, which slowed its evolution and allowed other languages like Ruby and Python to rise. Despite this, Perl remains useful and influential, especially for legacy systems and POSIX tasks.",

    "summary": "The term REST has been widely misused in the computer programming industry, with many people referring to any HTTP-based interface as a REST API. However, the true meaning of REST is centered around the concept of hypertext as a constraint. In order to be considered RESTful, an API must be driven by hypertext, with the API information necessary for interaction contained within the response itself. Unfortunately, most JSON APIs fall short of meeting this requirement, as they lack the self-describing nature of hypertext. Despite this, the term REST has stuck and is often used to describe APIs that are not truly RESTful.",

Gemini 3 and Antigravity can autonomously do complex computer tasks, create websites, and produce near–PhD level research while still needing human guidance.

    "summary": "Netscape 6.0 faced delays because the company decided to rewrite their code from scratch, which is a major mistake in software development. Starting over loses valuable bug fixes and knowledge gained from the existing code, putting the company at a disadvantage. Instead of rewriting, programmers should focus on improving and refactoring the existing code to enhance functionality without losing what already works.",
