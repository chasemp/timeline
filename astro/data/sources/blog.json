    "content_html": "<p>I remember hearing a lot of conflicting information about BGP when I first started doing network admin stuff. A lot of time BGP is part of an HA strategy and there are people making business decisions surrounding the protocol itself. This breakdown strives to be accurate and laymen without being misleading.</p>\n<p>Specific misconceptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You need a full time admin doing only BGP stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You can accidentally take down the Internet if you mess up.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>BGP is hard.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You do not need a &#39;full time&#39; person thinking about BGP around the clock, although you do need designated contacts for just-in-case scenarios. If your providers are handling their own business you don&#39;t have to worry about taking down the Internet. (Although some small version of this happened to YouTube <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1132256/networking.html\">http://www.macworld.com/article/1132256/networking.html</a>). BGP is no harder or easier than anything else. I have seen configurations that boggle the mind work for years. Correctly administered BGP does involves some savy.</p>\n<h3>What is BGP?</h3>\n<p>Usually referring to the current version 4. Just read it: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol</a></p>\n<h3>Seriously, What is BGP for though?</h3>\n<p>In order to have a service (or anything) available on the Internet it needs to be announced. Usually, your Internet Provider does this announcing for you. If you want to be the master of your own destiny you need to announce yourself. Literally, you say “here I am” to your provider. Your provider talks to other providers and before long everyone knows how to find you. When a user connects to their Internet provider they send a request for your service. Since you have made yourself known they can find you</p>\n<p>BGP is how we find groups of addressed devices on the Internet.</p>\n<h3>How can I start announcing myself?</h3>\n<p>In order to announce that you exist you need to have IP addresses. It&#39;s a non-human way for tracking down a resource; think phone numbers. The gentlemen at ARIN keep a big list of addresses in use. If you want to use BGP; you need addressing. If you want addressing; you talk to ARIN. There are two simultaneous IP address pools. The old is IPv4 and we are scraping the bottom of the bucket. That bucket was large enough to get the Internet this far (4 Billion+ addresses with a large chunk carved out for special reservations). The second bucket is called IPv6. IPv6 is a much deeper bucket, 3.4 x 10 to the 38th power. That is far, far, far more addresses than IPv4 has available. IPv6 has addresses reserved already for the Moon. Seriously.</p>\n<p>To get addresses you apply. It&#39;s that simple. <a href=\"https://www.arin.net/resources/request.html\">https://www.arin.net/resources/request.html</a></p>\n<h3>…almost that simple.</h3>\n<p>IPv4 is a dwindling resource. But it has been one for a long time. In my experience, getting an IPv6 block is very easy. Getting an IPv4 block requires more justification. Scarce resources are more valued. Without a block of my own addresses can I use BGP? Well, maybe. Some providers will allocate you a block of addresses from their pool. You don&#39;t own them. You may be able to advertise them out another provider if both providers agree that is reasonable. BGP is all about relationships. No provider has to allow you to announce your block on their network whether it has been issued to you or them. Thankfully providers are in the business of making money, and the only way to make money for them is to move traffic. If you can get an address block of your very own it is called Provider Independent Address Space. Meaning you can take your addresses and move to any provider that will have you. If you talk a provider into allocating you a block of addresses it is called Provider Dependent Address Space. In order to change providers you have to change IP blocks. It can be done.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Addressing</h3>\n<p>All address space given out is public information.</p>\n<p>Yahoo: <a href=\"http://whois.arin.net/rest/customer/C00146168\">http://whois.arin.net/rest/customer/C00146168</a>\nMozilla: <a href=\"http://whois.arin.net/rest/customer/C01111858\">http://whois.arin.net/rest/customer/C01111858</a></p>\n<h3>Wait…They want my ASN?</h3>\n<p>ASN is automomous system number. It is both a technical and a nontechnical entity. In a non-technical sense it is a number assigned to networks under a singular control. Some companies have multiple ASN&#39;s, but in general you join ARIN and you get an ASN. This ASN is unique to you, and it is how providers will know you.</p>\n<p>BGP thinks in ASN&#39;s.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s like this: You have a 1:1 relationship with your ASN, but a one-to-many relationship with your addressing space.</p>\n<p>Sort of like: You have a 1:1 relationship with your house address, but a one-to-many relationship for your house address\nto phone numbers associated with your address.</p>\n<p>Just Read it: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_(Internet)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_(Internet)</a></p>\n<h3>Why ASN&#39;s AND IP addresses?</h3>\n<p>When providers talk BGP to each other they refer to you and themselves by ASN number. That&#39;s the short version.</p>\n<p>BGP is a routing protocol. Most routing protocols rely on an addressing hierarchy. Therefore it&#39;s easy to follow the numbers and find your destination. If two roomates live in a house together and use the network 192.168.0.0/16 and they link up with their neighbors who use 172.16.0.0/16. They can point routes at each other and communications happens. If one roomate in the first house wants his own subnet they can break things down. 192.168.0.0/16 becomes 192.168.0.0/24 (first roomate) AND 192.168.1.0/24 (second roomate). But their neighbors still only use 192.168.0.0/16 as it&#39;s &#39;good enough&#39; to get to their house, and their house router knows how to distinguish between their rooms.</p>\n<p>BGP exists on a larger playing field. 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 could be assigned to people or companies that have no relationship to each other. Addressing on the Internet is not assigned in a way that makes it contiguous.</p>\n<p>It would be like if the two roomates were still using 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24 but had now moved to different addresses. We would need to find a way to associate their IP block with their new location. The location would be the ASN and the address block …would be the address block.</p>\n<p>So when two routers talk BGP to each other they say: ASN 1 has 192.168.0.0/24. ASN 2 has 192.168.1.0/24</p>\n<p>So if BGPRouter1 says this to BGPRouter2. BGPRouter1 has to be associated with an ASN too. Let&#39;s say BGPRouter1 has ASN 3. Now BGPRouter2 knows: when I need to get to ASN1 or ASN2 I send things to ASN3. Like, if I need to mail this letter to Les Sauvages, France the first step is getting it to France.</p>\n<h3>Summation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>BGP is how people find each other on the Internet. Usually providers worry about it.</li>\n<li>BGP is complex, but the basics are very straight forward.</li>\n<li>BGP is fundamental to understanding the Internet.</li>\n<li>ASN&#39;s can be assigned by ARIN. All you need to do is join.</li>\n<li>Addressing can be assigned by ARIN. All you need to do is apply.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "content_html": "<p>I have been thinking a lot about the term &quot;dogfooding&quot;.  A short hand for the idiom &#39;Eating your own dogfood&#39;.  A maxim that is often interpreted as a need to use your own products.\nI was in a discussion with a sales executive recently who related &quot;dogfooding&quot; is considered a faux pas in their circles.  It was described as having an unappealing mental picture.  The phrase &quot;drinking our own champagne&quot; is preferred.  It&#39;s even included in the Wikipedia page for &quot;Eating your own dogfood&quot; as an alternative.\nI think both phrases have meaning, but not the same meaning.</p>\n<p>No one WANTS to eat dogfood.  I imagine we all prefer to eat people food.  So why was the phrase coined this way?</p>\n<p>I believe it&#39;s because &quot;dogfooding&quot; is not only using our own products, it&#39;s using the rough, unappealing, unsettling, and often broken parts of our products.  It means intentionally not using your position as an insider to skirt the uncomfortable and inconvenient sharp edges users outside of your company are experiencing. It&#39;s difficult for me to fit that into a mental picture of sipping champagne. \n(It bears repeating) No one WANTS to eat dogfood.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve come to think of this as the Elixir Paradigm.  An elixir is a magical or medicinal potion.  It can make you live forever or cures all illness.  The irony is every telling of a story with a magical elixir at the heart seems to be a story of fine print and unintended side effects.  It&#39;s all Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail.  We can talk about the miracle, or we can talk about the fine print, but they both exist.  Dogfooding is an ethos that says we have to live the fine print to understand it.</p>\n<p>Dogfooding becomes that much more crucial when you are building a platform. Platforms expect to harness ecosystems of interrelated stakeholders, and ecosystems need growth to survive. That growth will in large part be contingent on the experience of those stakeholders with the rough, unappealing, unsettling, and often broken parts of the platform.</p>\n<p>I used to work at the Wikimedia Foundation.  We had Mediawiki coming out of our ears.  I&#39;ve seen the platform used for ticketing, an OpenStack console, chat, message boards, mailing lists, and on and on it goes.  Not all of these use cases for the platform survived, and I don&#39;t think that matters.  I always appreciated the willingness to discuss what use cases the platform could fulfill, and if it could, then the will to pursue it.  I have lost count (in the best way) of the number of times I have had the &quot;Should this be a Mediawiki extension?&quot; conversation.\nI want to build systems that find the compromise between safe and accessible, and, when applicable, dogfooding is required.  And yes, the name is terrible.</p>\n<p>Anyway, food for thought :)</p>\n<p>&quot;#dogfooding #security #productdevelopment</p>\n"

    "content_html": "<p>These are my personal anecdotal conclusions and I totally appreciate it may not line up with anyone else&#39;s. This is US centric, as that is my experience, and I learned IR “on the job” over a few decades.  YMMV.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Operational and security incidents often begin the same way, and may have the same impacts. Sometimes the separation boils down to intent.  That means your infrastructure operations team and your security operations team have to agree on what escalation means, when it matters, and how to document an ongoing investigation.  </li>\n<li>Response to a malicious incident is extremely time consuming. For every hour an adversary spends in control of a sensitive asset your organization may need to commit 3-10x+ in response. This is quarantining, establishing severity, determining depth of compromise, narrative development, investigation, remediation, evidence management, briefing external/in-house counsel, customer notification, high touch marquee customer meetings, law enforcement liaison, and more.</li>\n<li>Hostile actors are just as likely to be in time zones and on schedules that are not your own.  This will suck. An all hands on deck approach is not sustainable because the responders will be burnt up in 10-12 hours. It takes preparation, discipline and clear leave for folks to stand down during portions so there are hands available when the incident goes real-time beyond initial responder capacity.</li>\n<li>Boundaries and self-care are of the utmost importance. That said, my personal experience is that cautious bystanders seem to be rarely held to account for inaction. When information is scarce and it looks like a blast radius may be large, self-preservation may tell someone not to associate themselves.  Do not be surprised when folks go dark during triage or show up once the dust is settling and the damage is clearer. An incident will highlight the toxic cultural elements of an organization where blame, scapegoating, and politics rule. Do your best to not take it personally and to maintain your own state of mind.</li>\n<li>If the impact is serious, expect to need external help. Incident response is not something most in-house information security teams do enough of to avoid common pitfalls. Your lawyer will consult other lawyer&#39;s. Your evidence collection will similarly benefit from the hand of experience. Plus, if you collect in real-time with an external forensics firm <em>they</em> can be the people who have to testify in court.  Waiting until you need this augmentation is too late.  </li>\n<li>Your organization may have a cybersecurity component to their insurance policy.  This is a reactive mitigation (not a preventative control) but this is one of many reasons that cybersecurity needs a seat at the executive table.  There are almost certainly provisions for notification on breach depending on scope and impact.  Insurance makes money by not paying out.  Blend these requirements into your tabletop exercises.</li>\n<li>Readiness is the word I typically use to describe the extent to which an organization is prepared to handle the technical, legal, PR, and communications challenges of a compromise. This is often the most deficient area of an otherwise mature ISMS. Table tops are essential. Documentation on expected communications and an incident commander role are essential. Designated storage for evidence is essential. It&#39;s difficult to staff and fund these elements in most organizations. Usually you do not know, until you know.</li>\n<li>Escalating to the authorities is not a solution for immediate impact. Local police seem not to have jurisdiction or incentive. Federal police have significant discretion in what they pursue. Federal agencies will take your report and you may never meaningfully hear from them again. It is not the role of law enforcement officers to make your organization whole. They pursue criminals and sometimes contribute to recovering losses or damages as a result, but it is not their primary function. This does not mean do not involve law enforcement. It means they most likely will not be of immediate tactical assistance.</li>\n<li>If you do end up on the phone with a three letter agency, walk out the narrative of your evidence through the lens of quantifying impact on U.S. citizens. Generally, that is the narrative of consequence.</li>\n<li>Information Security is a series of tradeoffs for short-term confidentiality. The odds are overwhelming that encryption today will be trivial to break at some point in the future. Don&#39;t get mired in absolutes because there are few. Making your services and data an impractical and unattractive target (attackers do cost:benefit analysis just like you) is the idea. No defense is hands-off permanent, and no defense is 100% effective. That by itself does not mean it&#39;s a bad idea. Real-time ad hoc incident response mitigation measures can suffer from committee syndrome. No idea is perfect and gridlock ensues, or you end up with holes in your rain boots so your toes can breathe. A collection of hurdles is almost always the most effective defense.</li>\n<li>Confusion to your enemies! I have used mod_sec and JS fingerprinting to throw targeted HTTP 500&#39;s for endpoints based on prior attack patterns. It was shockingly effective.  A significant talking point opposing these types of measures may sound something like &quot;if we block their known traits we won&#39;t be able to effectively track their behavior&quot; and &quot;that is so easy to overcome it won&#39;t do any good&quot;. Attacker&#39;s cannot be both so sophisticated they are immune to new costs introduced by changes in response tactics AND be so predictable in pattern that they are being reliably monitored. Defense is hard and fatalism is paralyzing. Defense is primarily about dissuasion rather than absolutes.</li>\n<li>You are more likely to be compromised through an ancillary and/or support service than your primary production endpoints. Financial reimbursement portals, ticketing systems, development platforms, B2B integrations, and data warehouses for BI (this is a pot of gold) are attractive targets. The primary &quot;production&quot; systems probably get basic controls and oversight. Tech on the periphery is often some degree of skunkworks passion project &#39;this isn&#39;t what I was hired for but...&#39;, that had to skirt policy and controls to get rolling.</li>\n<li>Many companies I have experience with have a pervasive internal story outlining why they are not an attractive target for a cybersecurity attack. I suspect this is partially a coping mechanism, subconscious avoidance and recency bias. It is one of the most pernicious forces working against readiness. FUD is not a counterpoint. A consistent reinforcement of how readiness contributes to resilience and why that matters for the bottom line is all you have. It may not be enough, but that&#39;s the voice which represents systemic change on the wide arc.</li>\n<li>During response to an incident, from declaration to close, it is vitally important to differentiate three categories of information: assumptions (you have them, you need them, they often must be explicitly acknowledged), opinions (what you think may be happening) and facts (what you can prove to be true). A big part of readiness is learning how to communicate in this way. &quot;How do we know that?&quot; Is the first question out of my mouth when new information lands</li>\n<li>Incident response is an order of magnitude more effective in high trust teams. Recreating a timeline with overlapping motive and intent is full of speculation. Too much and you will drown in noise, too little and you will stall out into hoping blindly it doesn&#39;t happen again.</li>\n<li>The most dreaded attacker is not necessarily the most technical. I have seen quite a few incidents where we found ourselves saying &quot;If they only knew to do x that would have been 10 times worse&quot;. The scariest adversary has knowledge of your processes and tools, patience, and enough technical acumen to bridge those assets together.</li>\n<li>Malicious actors make mistakes. Full stop. Check for the obvious: shell history, sent messages, deleted messages, archive files, tmp, ss (netstat), etc. If you assume every hostile actor is above reproach you won&#39;t get very far.</li>\n<li>Identifying an attacker with high confidence is very, very difficult. That said, everyone has the tools they use without thinking. Pattern identification is a part of defense. Think in terms of persona rather than identity.  You are mitigating vulnerabilities, not threats.</li>\n<li>If you are at it long enough, someone will ask you about &quot;hacking back&quot;. They mean attacking the attacker. They will ask in a f2f/video meeting. This is personal liability territory and you would do well to ask for the request in writing from legal. That won&#39;t happen. If it does happen, my advice is don&#39;t do it.</li>\n<li>There may be pressure to minimize, downplay, spin, and outright lie about impact (or cause). The more toxic the environment, the more likely and insidious the coercion. Integrity is tantamount to credibility.</li>\n<li>You cannot prove a negative, and so absence of evidence is absence of conclusion. But not necessarily absence of activity. It&#39;s the best we can do. &quot;No evidence of...&quot;. &quot;No indication of...&quot;. This becomes your language when breach and incident disclosure are part of your duties.</li>\n</ol>\n"

This is fascinating and cumbersome. It&#39;s not unusual to find useful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_and_open-source_software&redirect=yes\">FLOSS</a> code that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware\">abandonware</a>, but it is a relatively new phenomenon for the code itself to be programmatically generated.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://openapi-generator.tech/\">OpenAPI Generator</a> (you are more likely to be familiar with <a href=\"https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/\">Swagger</a>)</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s my understanding of the value proposition, you&#39;ve written a server with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\">RESTful</a> API interface. Historically, it&#39;s been common practice to stub out some examples in documentation using <a href=\"https://curl.se/\">curl</a>. The mental leap to implementation of a client side library in a language of choice is fairly small, but it is not nonexistent. Folks come along and write idiomatic code to create a basic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit\">SDK</a> in their preferred language (example: <a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a> client libraries for <a href=\"https://github.com/redis/redis-py\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/redis/jedis\">Java</a>, and .<a href=\"https://github.com/redis/NRedisStack\">NET</a>). These language specific libraries can be of varying quality and completeness depending on the author, original needs, etc. Changes to how a server side endpoint behaves has to matriculate out to all the various client side libraries. It takes time, it&#39;s messy, and it&#39;s human maintenance.</p>\n<p>Queue the next evolution, you&#39;ve written a server with a RESTful API. You write a schema definition file that describes in declarative terms the semantics of the API. This <a href=\"https://yaml.org/\">YAML</a> file conforms to the <a href=\"https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0\">OpenAPI Specification (OAS)</a>. Now you can run one of 60+ generators to create consistent client side libraries to allow consumption of your API resources without a human writing novel code for this purpose. When you update your YAML schema you can similarly regenerate your client side code in every language. This is amazing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml\">Example</a> of an OpenAPI YAML schema:</p>\n<p>openapi: 3.0\nservers:\n  - url: &#39;<a href=\"http://petstore.swagger.io/v2\">http://petstore.swagger.io/v2</a>&#39;\ninfo:\n  description: &gt;-\n    This is a sample server Petstore server. For this sample, you can use the api key\n    `special-key` to test the authorization filters.\n  version: 1.0.0\n  title: OpenAPI Petstore\n  license:\n    name: Apache-2.0\n    url: &#39;<a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\">https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html</a>&#39;\ntags:\n  - name: pet\n    description: Everything about your Pets\n  - name: store\n    description: Access to Petstore orders\n  - name: user\n    description: Operations about user\npaths:\n  /pet:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - pet\n      summary: Add a new pet to the store\n      description: &#39;&#39;\n      operationId: addPet\n      responses:\n        &#39;200&#39;:\n          description: successful operation\n          content:\n            application/xml:\n              schema:\n                $ref: &#39;#/components/schemas/Pet&#39;\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: &#39;#/components/schemas/Pet&#39;0\n...</p>\n<p>Now imagine you write the YAML schema first and the code for the server side endpoint is generated (or more likely has the structure stubbed out), the client side libraries are generated in 60 languages, and the documentation portal to inform humans on the use case and particulars of consumption are consistent and published alongside both. This is even more amazing.</p>\n<p>Even though this is a glimpse of the future (opinion) it is not a panacea. The end result server side behavior has to match in exactitude to the description in the schema used to generate downstream artifacts. If not, something will be broken. I am experiencing exactly this issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.onelogin.com/\">Onelogin</a> is an identity and access management provider. I am attempting to use their <a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk\">client library for Python</a> that is generated using the OpenAPI specification described above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk/\"><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFELQB8GKMFAA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1673551169109?e=1762387200&v=beta&t=pX8pHPYq0cvGcHO6iBEb61t2HqqmC2YdHsY3dQVwMLs\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\"></a></p>\n<p>OpenAPI README header</p>\n<p>So, what is the bug?</p>\n<p>I believe I&#39;m seeing the same behavior in a few cases. Let&#39;s take the <a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk#getting-started\">getting started code</a> for generating a token and combine it with the <a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk/blob/master/docs/DefaultApi.md#get_user\">get_user</a> or the <a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk/blob/master/docs/DefaultApi.md#list_users\">list_users(app_id)</a> example.</p>\n<p>...\nuser = api_instance.get_user(user_id_int)</p>\n<p>users = api_instance.list_users(app_id_int)\n...</p>\n<p>These can result in some version of the following:</p>\n<p>onelogin.exceptions.ApiTypeError: Invalid type for variable &#39;preferred_locale_code&#39;. Required value type is str and passed type was NoneType at [&#39;received_data&#39;][&#39;preferred_locale_code&#39;]</p>\n<p>onelogin.exceptions.ApiTypeError: Invalid type for variable &#39;locked_until&#39;. Required value type is str and passed type was NoneType at [&#39;received_data&#39;][&#39;locked_until&#39;]</p>\n<p>onelogin.exceptions.ApiTypeError: Invalid type for variable &#39;trusted_idp_id&#39;. Required value type is int and passed type was NoneType at [&#39;received_data&#39;][&#39;trusted_idp_id&#39;]</p>\n<p>This is a classic mismatch in expected behavior between a client and server.</p>\n<p>What seem to be happening is the client side code is including the full list of possible params in the query, but in cases where a value is not specified explicitly in the code <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_none.asp\">None</a> is used as the value. The client is assuming with None being a <a href=\"https://www.pythonmorsels.com/truthiness/\">falsey</a> value it will be non-impacting. The server looks at the full request and recognizes parameters that are NoneType value but have another valid type required (int, str). It returns a status interpreted as an exception (error) by the client code. The server is assuming that any specified value is meaningful and seeking to validate adherence of expected object type.</p>\n<p>I can validate the server side is capable of fulfilling the request by using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/requests/\">python-requests</a> to make the same inquiries (including using the same generated token):</p>\n<p>import request</p>\n<p>class BearerAuth(requests.auth.AuthBase):\n    def __init__(self, token):\n        self.token = token\n    def __call__(self, r):\n        r.headers[&quot;authorization&quot;] = &quot;Bearer &quot; + self.token\n        return rs</p>\n<h1>Get users for APP <MYAPP> (int)</h1>\n<p>response = requests.get(&#39;<a href=\"https://api.us.onelogin.com/api/2/apps/\">https://api.us.onelogin.com/api/2/apps/</a><MYAPP>/users&#39;, auth=BearerAuth(token[&#39;access_token&#39;]))</p>\n<p>print(response.status_code)</p>\n<h1>Get details for user <MYUSER> (int)</h1>\n<p>user_details = requests.get(&#39;<a href=\"https://api.us.onelogin.com/api/2/users/\">https://api.us.onelogin.com/api/2/users/</a><MYUSER>&#39;, auth=BearerAuth(token[&#39;access_token&#39;]))</p>\n<p>print(user_details.status_code)</p>\n<p>Both queries return valid content and 200 status codes.</p>\n<p>At this point we have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server side code we cannot see but which we can demonstrate functions using primitive requests</li>\n<li>Client side code that is generated by an OpenAPI schema licensed with <a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk/blob/master/LICENSE\">MIT</a></li>\n<li>Client side behavior that is errant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Normally I would attempt to diagnose and search for an existing known issue to discuss, and, if possible, open a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request\">pull request</a> to address. In this case, the code itself is generated. Fixing it in place is not very useful. Any fix will be overwritten with the next generated version. The only real fix is addressing the OpenAPI schema document or the server side validation that is conflicting.</p>\n<p>While I have the code and rights to it the OpenAPI schema is not included.</p>\n<p><strong>This project is open source but still a walled garden.</strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, the project itself has been updated relatively recently.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGAy5aAx3MukQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1673552291803?e=1762387200&v=beta&t=796NJe7cVPvMhThohAFIXTslYLUglia5GmsARmqO9UU\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\"></p>\n<p>Updates happening for OneLogin Python SDK</p>\n<p>But issues seem to be stale with the last closed issue approximately a year ago.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFlikv-HDaXlg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1673552399989?e=1762387200&v=beta&t=9JSiuFY2zqTyORGb65zssfuhoSpD1e2Xs7UW21m1obY\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\"></p>\n<p>Activity in issues for OneLogin Python SDK</p>\n<p>The last comment on an open issue is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-python-sdk/issues/70\"><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEtQIkEAP4Wrw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1673552610769?e=1762387200&v=beta&t=Bur1sfQT4Fhw58Rk04K-Gu6PvVzRQjyFx5IN6OrW1yM\" alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\"></a></p>\n<p>OneLogin Python SDK issue #70 comment</p>\n<p>I&#39;m not writing this to take a shot at OneLogin. As the landscape of software development changes, there are interesting circumstances where the letter of the law and the intent of what it means to be open source may diverge. As humans create these technologies that allows us to be further removed from certain outcomes (a good thing), it seems we need to be careful about enabling the same social outcomes (a great thing) to preserve a collaborative future.</p>\n"

Though, I am genuinely glad all of this  <em>waves around</em> is here for those who enjoy it.\nI used to grab an early tea with a few folks at a job years ago to start the day.  We would chat about our lives, families, the weather, and the thoughts that lingered from the prior morning&#39;s conversation.</p>\n<p>Being friendly, in some cases, turned into being friends.

A few.  Chuckling at myself?  You bet.  Sneezing is a ridiculous and hilarious act.</p>\n<p>One of the untold experiences of working from home is when your cohabitators recognize the signs of a catastrophy that struck right as a meeting you cannot miss began.</p>\n<p>I came back to it.

Giscus fits these constraints by using GitHub Discussions as the backend. Comments appear on timeline items and blog posts, stored as GitHub Discussions and manageable within the repository.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>The integration has three components: global configuration, per-item control, and rendering.</p>\n<h3>Global Configuration</h3>\n<p>Comments can be disabled site-wide via <code>config.ts</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">export const config = {\n  commentsEnabled: true,\n} as const;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When set to false, comments are hidden everywhere. Individual items can still disable comments via hashtags.</p>\n<h3>Per-Item Control</h3>\n<p>Specific items can disable comments using the <code>#nocomments</code> or <code>#nc</code> hashtag. This works across content types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog posts: add the tag to markdown frontmatter</li>\n<li>Timeline items: add the hashtag in content text or as a tag</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rendering</h3>\n<p>For blog posts, Giscus loads with a pathname mapping strategy. Each post gets its own discussion thread. The script loads when the page loads and renders below the content.</p>\n<p>For timeline items, Giscus loads dynamically when opening an item. The script is removed when closing the panel to avoid conflicts. This keeps the timeline responsive.</p>\n<h2>Technical Details</h2>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>Giscus connects to the <code>chasemp/timeline</code> repository with the category &quot;Ideas&quot; (category ID <code>DIC_kwDOQDOMbM4CxLZb</code>). The mapping strategy is &quot;specific&quot; for timeline items, using the item ID as the discussion term. Blog posts use pathname mapping.</p>\n<p>A custom theme in <code>giscus-custom.css</code> centers the sign-in button and positions it at the top of the comments section.</p>\n<h3>Error Handling</h3>\n<p>If Giscus fails to load, the comments section hides after a 10-second timeout. This prevents displaying empty sections and keeps the interface clean.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://giscus.app/\">Giscus documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository\">GitHub Discussions configuration</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

I spent more time in the car and at the office than I did at home, which was no longer working for me.</p>\n<p>I decided to make a leap to a &quot;remote first&quot; opportunity, and I&#39;ve been working remotely on globally distributed teams since that time, now almost 15 years.</p>\n<p>This is a personal reflection on remote work as a lifestyle that has shaped my life and my family.</p>\n<h2>A Story That Stuck With Me</h2>\n<p>I remember being at an OpenStack conference in Vancouver in 2018, one of those &quot;birds of a feather&quot; open spaces sessions where people gather to discuss a common concern or theme. Distributed work at the time was treated a bit as a curiosity with its own subculture, and those of us who worked remotely gathered to talk about our experiences. A gentleman from Red Hat stood up and shared a sentiment that has stayed with me.</p>\n<p>He acknowledged that being fully remote might have impacted his visibility in certain ways: maybe his pace of promotion, maybe certain &quot;in-office&quot; opportunities. But in exchange, he had walked his daughter to school every single day from kindergarten through high school.</p>\n<p>He was misty-eyed as he said it, and I felt the same. It hit home.</p>\n<p>For me, remote work has never been about &quot;slacking off&quot;, avoiding responsibility, or an out-of-sight out-of-mind prospect. It&#39;s been a lifestyle choice. It&#39;s the ability to be present for little moments that matter while maintaining a professional standard that is just as rigorous, if not more so, than a shared office environment.</p>\n<h2>Setting Boundaries</h2>\n<p>The success of this lifestyle depends on structure and intentionality.</p>\n<p>In our house, I&#39;ve been working &quot;from home&quot; since my kids can remember, and we started with well-defined boundaries from the beginning. I have a separate office, and even when the kids were little, they understood the &quot;closed door&quot; rule: if the door is shut, I&#39;m at work. Unless it&#39;s an emergency, I&#39;m not &quot;home&quot; yet.</p>\n<p>I treat remote work with the same respect as a vocation on location.</p>\n<p>That said, there are these small daily rhythms that make the lifestyle pleasurable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making a cup of coffee in my own kitchen</li>\n<li>Sitting on the porch for ten minutes during lunch to look at the trees</li>\n<li>Switching a load of laundry between meetings</li>\n<li>Eating lunch with my daughters at the table for half an hour when they were little</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do not classify these as &quot;distractions.&quot;</p>\n<p>They are elements of a balanced life. But they only work because of those firm boundaries. Without the discipline, the &quot;lifestyle&quot; side of remote work can collapse into burnout and overwhelm.</p>\n<h2>Work as Output, Not Location</h2>\n<p>Long before I went fully remote, I learned that where you are has little to do with whether you&#39;re working.</p>\n<p>I remember one interesting example from my last &quot;on location&quot; job. I was doing security and systems administration engineering, and we served international customers with an agreed upon downtime maintenance window from 2 to 4 AM.</p>\n<p>As was typical for these maintenance overnights, I went to bed at 8 PM, woke up at 12:30 AM, loaded equipment into my car, and drove downtown to a data center. I checked in through co-location security well before the 2 AM window, worked through the maintenance, and wasn&#39;t done until around 7 AM. At that point, I&#39;d put in nearly a full day.</p>\n<p>It was typical at that time to go into the office afterward to debrief. I drove there, paused for breakfast, and badged in around 11 AM.</p>\n<p>The next week, it came back to me that someone had lodged a complaint. My team wasn&#39;t getting to the office until almost lunchtime. It was described as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.</p>\n<p>These folks had no idea I&#39;d been working since the middle of the night. Rather than a short day, it was a 12-hour day. The complaint got all the way to my manager. We talked through it, confirmed what had actually happened, and it was dropped. But it highlighted a weird perception bubble that was never addressed and often misunderstood.</p>\n<p>That stuck with me. The perception gap of when and where work is happening exists no matter what the structure is. Remote or not.</p>\n<p>In systems engineering and security, you are often expected to work off-hours. You are on-call. I&#39;ve worked Christmas Day with my laptop out and the discarded pieces of present wrapping around me. I&#39;ve spent the entirety of &quot;Black Friday&quot; in the whirlwind of a datacenter. I&#39;ve been pulled over on the side of the road with my family in the car for an hour walking someone through how to fix an issue on a Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>This is all fine.</p>\n<p>Not lovable, yet I knew what I was getting into. But even with these concrete expressions of off-hours commitment and need, there was this underlying cognitive dissonance: if you&#39;re not in the office, you&#39;re not working. Except when we need you to carry a computer and work from wherever you are, whenever we need it.</p>\n<p>It was a strange contradiction that highlighted something important: work had already been happening from many different locations and at many different times. The office was one of them.</p>\n<p>If work is not about location then it must be about focus, effort and output. That&#39;s been true as far back as I&#39;ve been doing this kind of work, all the way to working as a district technician driving between schools within the district during my senior year of high school.</p>\n<p>Before I left the 2-4AM maintenance window job, I had a conversation with my manager about establishing remote days as fully supported, especially after overnight maintenance windows. The feedback wasn&#39;t supportive. One of the most senior engineers said, and I quote: &quot;My dad laid brick and he was never able to work from home. And I don&#39;t expect to either. We all need to be here. That&#39;s the job.&quot;</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve thought about that a lot. Every vocation has advantages and constraints. The idea that because physical labor requires being on-site, knowledge workers configuring systems remotely should be held to that same standard seems archaic.</p>\n<p>I have family members who do physical trades (tool and die, mechanics, tree trimming) and none of them begrudge me the ability to work remotely. It&#39;s a benefit, even a privilege, but it&#39;s not punitive against them. This flavor of pushback is often reactionary, based on unfamiliarity rather than evidence.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, both the manager in question and that senior engineer went on to work fully remotely for a different company a few years later. We stayed in touch over the years and have since gone to events together. I&#39;m not bitter or indignant over any of it, but it stayed with me.</p>\n<h2>Remote is Nothing New</h2>\n<p>There are quagmires of pushback about remote work not being &quot;effective.&quot; That feels like a misunderstanding of how modern business has functioned for decades.</p>\n<p>Even in &quot;office-first&quot; companies, if you have a satellite office or a team in another city, you are already working remotely – to someone. We&#39;ve been collaborating across distances long before the pandemic forced everyone&#39;s hand. My great-grandfather was a telegraph operator and my reading of that tells me that as soon as the advantages of collaborating across distance in real-time were available they were seized. President Lincoln coordinated Union generals during the Civil War via telegraph. Banks began &quot;wiring money&quot; across continents. The Titanic&#39;s sinking was reported globally within hours. Remote collaboration isn&#39;t new. We&#39;ve been refining it for over 150 years.</p>\n<p>If you need proof that distributed collaboration works at scale, look at open source. The infrastructure powering the modern world (the Linux kernel, Kubernetes, React, Python, Go) was all built by remote globally distributed teams. These aren&#39;t small hobby projects. They&#39;re foundational systems that literally run global commerce, healthcare systems, and critical infrastructure. And they were built by people who, more often than not, rarely meet face-to-face.</p>\n<p>Engineering efforts at global scale clearly do not require physical proximity. What they require is intrinsic motivation, frameworks for collaboration, asynchronous tooling, a writing culture, and a culture of communicating ideas and debate.</p>\n<p>The open source ecosystem has been proving for decades that remote collaboration can produce not only functional work, but world-class, mission-critical systems. If anything, the distributed model seems to be an advantage when you&#39;re trying to pull together the best expertise from around the world.</p>\n<p>When leading an organization, you can explicitly find ways to make collaboration asynchronous and remote as a first-class consideration, or perpetually deal with second-class solutions in those inevitable situations. It&#39;s a strategic decision about priorities.</p>\n<h2>The IRC Generation</h2>\n<p>I believe part of why remote work felt so natural to me goes back to coming of age in the late &#39;90s and early 2000s. I spent a lot of time online in chat rooms and on forums, building friendships and connection with people I&#39;d never met in person. Some of those friendships have lasted many years, and I still haven&#39;t met some of those folks in person. And that&#39;s okay.</p>\n<p>That experience normalized the idea that meaningful connection and collaboration don&#39;t require physical proximity. You can build trust, share ideas, solve problems, and genuinely know someone without ever sharing the same physical space. That said, meeting in person can absolutely jumpstart and accelerate this process.</p>\n<h2>The Sitcom Fallacy</h2>\n<p>There is a convenient fiction in sitcoms and movies where if two people have a misunderstanding or argument, it is followed by some happenstance encounter, bumping into each other at a coffee shop, or ending up at the same party, and suddenly the space and opportunity to talk things over, make amends, and move forward is thrust upon them.</p>\n<p>The thing is, life doesn&#39;t really work like that. Remote or not.</p>\n<p>You have to explicitly seek those outcomes. And in remote work, even more so. You have to really try.</p>\n<p>If you only ever talk to your colleagues when there&#39;s a problem to solve, a ticket to close, or a project to deliver, you&#39;re not actually getting to know people. You&#39;re processing data together.</p>\n<p>I call this the need for &quot;non-objective oriented communication&quot;: conversations that aren&#39;t about anything in particular, chatting over tea (or coffee, in my case).</p>\n<h2>The Value of Face Time</h2>\n<p>Remote work is most effective for close collaboration when I understand and know the people I&#39;m working with. That has often been bolstered by getting together in person, ideally two or three times a year depending on the team and the context.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s something about spending time with someone face-to-face that changes how you communicate with them afterward. You learn how they phrase things, their tone of voice, their mannerisms, and sense of humor. I have had much more effective communication with some people after spending a few days with them in person.</p>\n<p>I heard a story about the first MediaWiki Developer Summit in San Francisco in 2015, which was before I worked at the Wikimedia Foundation. There had been this backlog of big architectural decisions (around service-oriented architecture, API design, that sort of thing) that were difficult to get buy-in on. Everyone was busy, heads-down in their own work. When you&#39;re remote and things aren&#39;t invading your space, you can be in the flow and focused. Which is great most of the time, but it also means big, non-urgent decisions can languish.</p>\n<p>So they got everyone together in a room. People presented their architectural proposals, and suddenly all these decisions that had been stuck for months were made in a short amount of time. The interesting thing is, they then developed mechanisms for making those kinds of decisions without needing to gather physically. But it took that initial in-person forcing function to break through. The summit became an annual thing and eventually evolved into what&#39;s now the Wikimedia Technical Conference.</p>\n<p>Remote does not mean never meeting in person. In fact, the opposite. Coming together should be regular and planned.</p>\n<p>When I worked at Wikimedia, we had in-person meetings twice a year: once for the whole company and once for the team. I was fortunate enough to participate in leadership training that brought together managers and horizontal leaders from across the organization. We&#39;d meet in person a handful of times, build relationships with people we didn&#39;t work with day-to-day, then go back to our distributed realities.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, those meetings were some of the most high-value introductions and in person get-togethers I&#39;ve ever had. And they had almost nothing directly to do with the execution of the technical work I did day-to-day. They were about building trust. They were about building rapport. They were about understanding what other people care about. They were about human connection.</p>\n<p>Because of those relationships, I was able to get things done, make moves, build support for initiatives and outcomes that I don&#39;t believe I would have been able to otherwise. It wasn&#39;t that the people were different, or that I was different. It was our relationship that was different. They knew I was earnest. They knew what I cared about. They saw I didn&#39;t have ulterior motives. I wanted to do good work, build good teams, and progress the mission.</p>\n<p>Trust is the ultimate currency in teamwork, especially on teams where the edges only touch once in a while or where there isn&#39;t a lot of deep rapport building organically.</p>\n<p>These in-person gatherings are strategic investments in team effectiveness. You&#39;re going to spend a lot of the money you would have spent on a single physical location getting people together periodically. But there are advantages: you get to maybe go to a new location, it&#39;s much more focused time than it would be otherwise, and you can explicitly carve out novel shared experiences to get to know folks.</p>\n<p>One of the most pernicious misconceptions about remote is that it&#39;s by nature a cheaper model. It&#39;s not cheaper. It&#39;s different.</p>\n<h2>Cultivating Remote Culture</h2>\n<p>I do believe that intentionally cultivated remote cultures can be as effective, if not more effective, than traditional office environments. But even if the playing field is even, there&#39;s a massive strategic advantage: you can hire and bring in talent from anywhere (a point often made).</p>\n<p>If you solve for distributed collaboration at the micro level (per employee, so to speak) you unlock the ability to pull in expertise from wherever you need it – which includes internally. You&#39;re not limited by your zip code; you&#39;re limited by your communication frameworks.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s my opinion: you&#39;re never going to have everyone you want in the same office, in the same room, at the same time, for all the times you want it. As any company scales, you&#39;re going to deal with people not being in the same city, state, or building. These challenges are part and parcel with growth. Designing for it upfront is an advantage.</p>\n<h2>Managing Remote Teams</h2>\n<p>One theme I saw a lot in the early days of pandemic remote was that some folks had a real hard time even envisioning managing others who were remote to them.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve run multiple teams remotely, and what I&#39;ve found is that remote work provides an opportunity for a lot of clarity in terms of what people are doing, when, and where. You really end up having to talk about outcomes and impact rather than time in a room or in a space.</p>\n<p>That can be hard because when you&#39;re remote, unless you crest the hill and tie something off to show, it can be difficult to say, &quot;Well, I spent all this time figuring out ways not to make a light bulb,&quot; to quote Edison. But that&#39;s just a conversation you need to have.</p>\n<p>Being remote and being a manager comes with challenges, but it also provides benefits, just like in-person management does. In my experience, it&#39;s been great. It just requires a different set of considerations and measurables.</p>\n<h2>Pandemic Remote Was Different</h2>\n<p>I want to acknowledge that pandemic remote was a very atypical experience.</p>\n<p>Everything was hard. People were often isolated in their houses. It wasn&#39;t planned for. It was a thing that was thrust upon people who didn&#39;t build up to it. Many folks understandably missed their routines, missed really just being around people.</p>\n<p>When remote work is viewed as a lifestyle, part of that lifestyle is having social outlets outside of the &quot;non-office.&quot;</p>\n<p>The struggle people felt during the pandemic wasn&#39;t a failure of remote work; it was the hardship of isolation, lack of planning, and being thrust into a situation that was scary, indefinite, and isolating. Sustainable remote work requires social outlets and deliberate communication, which was difficult during a national quarantine.</p>\n<h2>Not For Everyone</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve always been someone who needs a fair amount of alone time and downtime. That personality trait probably makes remote work easier for me than it might be for others. If you thrive on social interaction and need that energy from being around people all day, remote work might be more challenging.</p>\n<p>I have seen a lot of interesting setups, one of them is the use of co-working spaces with kitchens, meeting rooms, and a lobby for those who want to share a space. Socializing is organized around location but not employment. I tried it briefly and it didn&#39;t suit my needs, but I have seen it be exceptionally functional.</p>\n<h2>The Remote Network Effect</h2>\n<p>One interesting thing I&#39;ve noticed over the years is that working at dedicated remote companies creates its own kind of informal network. I&#39;ve known so many people who worked at remote-first organizations that there&#39;s almost this secondary ecosystem: a network of people who all value remote work and are looking for those kinds of opportunities.</p>\n<p>That community can be its own kind of social center, a professional ecosystem built around shared values about how work should, or can, function.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>This isn&#39;t a condemnation of the office or a declaration that everyone should work remotely. Some people genuinely prefer the structure and social rhythm of an office, and that&#39;s perfectly valid.</p>\n<p>After 15 years, I&#39;ve found that the trade-off of being there more as my kids grow up, having the flexibility to make coffee in my own kitchen, sitting on my porch and looking at the leaves is a return on investment that no office perk could ever match.</p>\n<p>The &quot;water cooler&quot; talk is different in remote work. But the connections can be as deep, the work as effective, and the life you build around it significantly aligned with what matters to you. Whether you&#39;re remote or in an office, the fundamentals are the same: dedicated time to connect as people, not just as coworkers, builds trust. Trust is necessary for change, and change is the only constant.Remote work is a lifestyle. And for me, it&#39;s been the right one.</p>\n"
