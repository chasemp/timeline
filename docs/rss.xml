If I look at the past +10 years, I think the hardest message to bring to teams is: plan less. I start collecting data as soon as I can and I look at:

what was
- planned: by counting, and story points (if they have them)
- added during sprint
- removed during sprint
- delivered
I then calculate the total for all these numbers of the last 10 sprints

What I have learned:

1) Most (all?) teams plan consistent more then they can chew
2) at least 20% unpredictable work gets added
3) Many teams don&apos;t remove work when things get added
4) Most stories are longer then 1 sprint (I saw an average of 12 sprints)
5) In many cases the so called &quot;most experiences developer&quot; is the hardest person to convince (not a manager)
6) No one has any idea of the real velocity
7) When people say a team is unpredictable, in most cases they are rather predictable (as in consistent deliver about the same amount of work) yet their promises are all over the place: sometimes over promising and next sprint under promising. Mostly because of 6
8) They don&apos;t know the lead time, not per work item, not average
9) The delivery frequency is all over the place 
10) strict delivery rules for planned releases, yet almost no rules for urgent fixes
11) no data on nr failed releases 
12) no data on recovery time: how long does it take to fix a problem in production

Eg they think they are doing scrum, but they don&apos;t
I started by saying it was the hardest message, also the one where I have most succes with.

My advice 
13) start collecting data on all these numbers 
14) yes the extra work might be unpredictable, yet in most teams the % of extra work is rather consistent or cyclic
15) keep a buffer for the extra work that is at least as high as your current % 
16) split work into smaller work that can be delivered and tested in a week or less
All teams tell me it is impossible in their work. In 90% of the cases they are better in it a year later
17) find and show the consistency in these numbers
18) talk ab...</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:54:45 GMT</pubDate><author>Yves Hanoulle (he/him) 🇺🇦 🏳️🌈</author><category>saved</category><category>Article Shared</category></item><item><title>[Article Shared] Is Query Optimization a “Solved” Problem?</title><link>https://wp.sigmod.org/?p=1075</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://wp.sigmod.org/?p=1075</guid><description>Query optimization is far from solved because wrong estimates of intermediate result sizes (cardinalities) break plans.

The author argues that using story points to predict project timelines is a weak idea and tracking actuals compared to estimates is at best wasteful. Managers&apos; pressure to deliver more and comparing teams are potential issues that arise with the use of story points. The author suggests slicing stories into smaller ones of high value requiring little time to do as slicing offers better value compared to story estimates.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 16:23:32 GMT</pubDate><author>ronjeffries.com</author><category>saved</category><category>Article Shared</category></item><item><title>[Article Shared] AWS Re:invent</title><link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/08/aws_reinvent_keynote_recap_corey_quinn/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/08/aws_reinvent_keynote_recap_corey_quinn/</guid><description>AWS re:Invent keynote was mostly dull until the last ten minutes of rapid product announcements.

However, the true meaning of REST is centered around the concept of hypertext as a constraint. In order to be considered RESTful, an API must be driven by hypertext, with the API information necessary for interaction contained within the response itself. Unfortunately, most JSON APIs fall short of meeting this requirement, as they lack the self-describing nature of hypertext. Despite this, the term REST has stuck and is often used to describe APIs that are not truly RESTful.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 18:07:57 GMT</pubDate><author>htmx.org</author><category>saved</category><category>Article Shared</category></item><item><title>[Article Shared] Portfolios Across the U.S. Wealth Distribution</title><link>https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-39</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-39</guid><description>Household wealth is assets minus debts, and portfolio mix affects how wealth grows over time. Middle‑wealth households hold more physical assets like homes, while the wealthy hold more stocks and businesses. Wealth and portfolio differences also relate to age and race, with Black households holding less home, stock, and business equity largely because they have lower overall wealth and different household/age profiles.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:59:29 GMT</pubDate><author>John Bailey Jones</author><category>saved</category><category>Article Shared</category></item><item><title>[Article Shared] Brook Schoenfield’s Post</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brookschoenfield_a-comparative-benchmark-study-of-llm-based-activity-7399121036497178625-FU3G?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAABA7PwgB0iKxrYkDf2yq5phKyiYm5EjipwM</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brookschoenfield_a-comparative-benchmark-study-of-llm-based-activity-7399121036497178625-FU3G?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAABA7PwgB0iKxrYkDf2yq5phKyiYm5EjipwM</guid><description>A new study shows AI threat models still lag behind expert-created ones, so hire specialists for deep, thorough analysis.

Each agent&apos;s actions are recorded in a secure, append-only chain, ensuring accountability and data integrity within applications.
