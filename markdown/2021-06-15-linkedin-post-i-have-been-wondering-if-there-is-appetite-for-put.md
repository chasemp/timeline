I have been wondering if there is appetite for putting a new book on the agenda.
Candidates from my to-be-read list:

the story of my life (hellen keller)
thinking, fast and slow (daniel kahneman)
the innovator's dilemma (clayton christenson)
love as a business strategy (anwar, danna)

I am open but wanted to put something out there.
