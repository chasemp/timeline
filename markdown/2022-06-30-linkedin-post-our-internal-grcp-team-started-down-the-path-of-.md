Our internal GRC(P) team started down the path of introducing https://www.rfpio.com a few months ago.
I just got off a call where the SE team was now in the drivers seat educating our PMs (and others) on the process, value, and workflow.  I've rarely seen a tool take off this organically at a company, and I do believe there are cases where a great new tool can redefine the work.  I love it when coworkers pull together to make something better.  Satisfying stuff.

“If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.” – Abraham Lincoln.

I am in no way affiliated or associated with RFPio, other than working for a customer of theirs.
