My second day at a job in 2007 I showed up early.  I came in the unlocked front doors and I set off an insane alarm.  <!--more--> Strobe lights were in effect.  I left a voicemail for my boss that has become something of urban legend.  One of my coworkers posted it on his blog Caffeinatedcoder (which is no longer) and it got picked up by someone who blogs regularly at Microsoft.  It was associated with another urban legend story at MS about a new employee dinging the car of someone with the lastname Gates.

I find the whole thing funny.  It is part of my history now.  Someday I may own up my second 'Internet Notorious' moment.
