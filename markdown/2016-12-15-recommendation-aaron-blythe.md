## Recommendation Details

**Recipient**: Aaron Blythe  
**Position**: Customer Engineer, Google Cloud Platform, Google  
**Date**: December 15, 2016

## Recommendation Text

"Without Aaron there would have been no conference. He brought everyone together and made sure efforts were moving in a single direction. I know that it's not easy to bring leadership to a disconnected group of volunteers who are used to running things in their own domains of expertise. I wouldn't hesitate to be involved in another conference where Aaron is the lead."

## Professional Impact

This recommendation recognizes Aaron's exceptional leadership skills in organizing conferences and coordinating diverse groups of technical volunteers.
