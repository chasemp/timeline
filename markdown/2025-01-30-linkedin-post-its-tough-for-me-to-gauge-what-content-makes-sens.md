It's tough for me to gauge what content makes sense for Linkedin.  This whole "social networking" to "social media" transition feels like an ill fitting shirt."

I'm not really interested in growing a follower base for its own sake, anymore than I'm interested in inviting thousands of people over for dinner and drinks at one time. 

Of course, It *is* neat to express a feeling, an interest or a thought and know it resonated with someone else.  I value human connection, new perspective, and shared journey. 

"I like people, really.  I don't feel haughty, self-righteous or ego bound about it.  I'm just ...shy? reserved? contemplative? I'm not sure.  I'm not comfortable if I feel "on display".  Though, I am genuinely glad all of this  *waves around* is here for those who enjoy it."

I used to grab an early tea with a few folks at a job years ago to start the day.  We would chat about our lives, families, the weather, and the thoughts that lingered from the prior morning's conversation.  

Being friendly, in some cases, turned into being friends.  That was nice.

I was pondering this because as I lifted my full cup of coffee to my mouth this morning an immense surprise sneeze hit me.  

Pants? Soaked.  Shirt? Survivable. Curses?  A few.  Chuckling at myself?  You bet.  Sneezing is a ridiculous and hilarious act.

One of the untold experiences of working from home is when your cohabitators recognize the signs of a catastrophy that struck right as a meeting you cannot miss began.

I came back to it.  All is well now.  But I wondered if sharing mirth such as this fits the mold here, if it matters, and I miss those morning tea sessions.

"Thanks for listening.
