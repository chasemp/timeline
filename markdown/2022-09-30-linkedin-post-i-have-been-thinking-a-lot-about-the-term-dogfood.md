I have been thinking a lot about the term "dogfooding".  A short hand for the idiom 'Eating your own dogfood'.  A maxim that is often interpreted as a need to use your own products.
I was in a discussion with a sales executive recently who related "dogfooding" is considered a faux pas in their circles.  It was described as having an unappealing mental picture.  The phrase "drinking our own champagne" is preferred.  It's even included in the Wikipedia page for "Eating your own dogfood" as an alternative.
I think both phrases have meaning, but not the same meaning.

No one WANTS to eat dogfood.  I imagine we all prefer to eat people food.  So why was the phrase coined this way?

I believe it's because "dogfooding" is not only using our own products, it's using the rough, unappealing, unsettling, and often broken parts of our products.  It means intentionally not using your position as an insider to skirt the uncomfortable and inconvenient sharp edges users outside of your company are experiencing. It's difficult for me to fit that into a mental picture of sipping champagne. 
(It bears repeating) No one WANTS to eat dogfood.

I've come to think of this as the Elixir Paradigm.  An elixir is a magical or medicinal potion.  It can make you live forever or cures all illness.  The irony is every telling of a story with a magical elixir at the heart seems to be a story of fine print and unintended side effects.  It's all Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail.  We can talk about the miracle, or we can talk about the fine print, but they both exist.  Dogfooding is an ethos that says we have to live the fine print to understand it.

Dogfooding becomes that much more crucial when you are building a platform. Platforms expect to harness ecosystems of interrelated stakeholders, and ecosystems need growth to survive. That growth will in large part be contingent on the experience of those stakeholders with the rough, unappealing, unsettling, and often broken parts of the platform.

I used to work at the Wikimedia Foundation.  We had Mediawiki coming out of our ears.  I've seen the platform used for ticketing, an OpenStack console, chat, message boards, mailing lists, and on and on it goes.  Not all of these use cases for the platform survived, and I don't think that matters.  I always appreciated the willingness to discuss what use cases the platform could fulfill, and if it could, then the will to pursue it.  I have lost count (in the best way) of the number of times I have had the "Should this be a Mediawiki extension?" conversation.
I want to build systems that find the compromise between safe and accessible, and, when applicable, dogfooding is required.  And yes, the name is terrible.

Anyway, food for thought :)
