## Recommendation Details

**From**: Mukunda Modell  
**Position**: Senior Software Engineer, Playco  
**Date**: June 29, 2024

## Recommendation Text

"Chase is extremely competent and great to work with. One of the best of the best. I had the good fortune to work with Chase on multiple occasions, first at DeviantArt and then again and Wikimedia. We collaborated closely on the rollout of Phabricator at Wikimedia, a project which was a success by all metrics, due in no small part to Chase's contribution. After that, Chase moved on to hold several important roles and Wikimedia and his work was always impeccable. If I was looking to add someone to my team, or recommending someone for a trusted position, then Chase would be at the top of my list."

## Professional Recognition

This recommendation from a long-time collaborator highlights my technical competence, collaborative skills, and successful project delivery across multiple organizations.
