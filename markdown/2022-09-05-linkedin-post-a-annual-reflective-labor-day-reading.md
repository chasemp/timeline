A annual reflective Labor Day reading.
> All Labor Has Dignity” at Bishop Charles Mason Temple of the Church of God in Christ in Memphis, Tennessee.

But let me say to you tonight, that whenever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and is for the building of humanity, it has dignity, and it has worth. One day our society must come to see this. One day our society will come to respect the sanitation worker if it is to survive, for the person who picks up our garbage, in the final analysis, is as significant as the physician, for if he doesn’t do his job, diseases are rampant. All labor has dignity.
