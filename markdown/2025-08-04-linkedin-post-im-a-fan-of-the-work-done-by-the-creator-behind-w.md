I'm a fan of the work done by the creator behind Woodworking for Mere Mortals.  Here is a piece written for the Wood Working and associated creator community that is outside of "tech" but, like seemingly all things, still attached to it.
I choose to be optimistic about the future of making and creating. Technology is demanding that we dig deeper into the meaning of what we produce. Play with the technology and allow yourself to explore. You can't compete with perfection, so don't set your goal to become a machine.
"-- Steve Ramsey, WWMM
