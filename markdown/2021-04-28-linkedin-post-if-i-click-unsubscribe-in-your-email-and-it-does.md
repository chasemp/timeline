If I click 'unsubscribe' in your email and it does anything other than its namesake I file your company or project away in my brain as not respecting my time.
If your email obscures (not showing unsubscribe as a URL when others are) the directive I file your company or project away as not respecting my time.

If you inject ads (or unrelated content) I file your company or project away as not respecting my time.

If you use sane mailing list software (e.g. mailman3) that requires me to login -- fine. Cool. Thanks for being you.
