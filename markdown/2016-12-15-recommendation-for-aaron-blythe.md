Without Aaron there would have been no conference.  He brought everyone together and made sure efforts were moving in a single direction.  I know that it's not easy to bring leadership to a disconnected group of volunteers who are used to running things in their own domains of expertise.  I wouldn't hesitate to be involved in another conference where Aaron is the lead.
