## Recommendation Details

**From**: Andrew Amburn  
**Position**: Senior Cybersecurity Advisor, Archer Integrated Risk Management  
**Date**: July 2, 2024

## Recommendation Text

"Chase has been my manager for the past 3 months. During that time I've found him to be a phenomenal manager and co-worker. It's rare that you find a person that has the aptitude to do, the charisma to lead, and the awareness / intuition needed to thrive across business domains in order to achieve security objectives. Oh, and also is a really awesome human. And that's Chase, in a nutshell. He is an excellent manager. He leads by example and has incredible breadth and depth of knowledge. Managers are responsible for creating team culture, and that honestly makes or breaks the workplace. As a member of Chase's team I have found an environment in which I am trusted, given latitude and space to direct my time, and also where I have support when / where needed, and where Chase puts up guardrails to ensure we stay on task. Such environments, and such managers, are rare and valuable indeed. So valuable to me, in fact, that the primary reason I accepted the position is because Chase is the kind of person I would want to work for, and his team the kind of team I would want to work on. If ever someone is considering Chase for a position in the future, I hope that you re-read that previous sentence. Good leaders are magnetic and will recruit, and retain, good employees. Highly recommended and highly respected."
