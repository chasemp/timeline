This is my favorite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr quote:"
"
"“One day we must come to see that peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but that it is a means by which we arrive at that goal. We must pursue peaceful ends through peaceful means.”"
"
"---"

"I have believed for a long time that the adage 'the end justifies the means' is near-sighted and miscalculation.  This was the first quote I found that resonated this personally held truth, and I felt connection.  Because wherever you are trying to go, as a human or team, how you choose to get there will greatly impact where you actually end up.   "
