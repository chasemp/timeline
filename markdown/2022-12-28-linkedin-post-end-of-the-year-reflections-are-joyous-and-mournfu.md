End of the year reflections are joyous and mournful.  This poem "Risk" has me coming back to it today.  It stands on its own, but for me I am asking myself, risk to what and why?  
In an environment often filled with data driven idealism and echoed extrinsic motivators, it is interesting that the only valuable answers may be inescapably subjective.

I have made some genuine friends through this platform in 2022.  A very welcome and appreciated surprise for me.  I hope you are all well and finding reasons to be exuberant about the year to come.

I have written this line for myself to start 2023:

A career is more than a job but less than a life.

Best,

Chase
