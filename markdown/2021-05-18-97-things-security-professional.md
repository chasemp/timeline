In this contribution to the acclaimed 97 Things series, I explore the critical concept that effective information security isn't about having the right toolsâ€”it's about aligning security objectives with business goals and making risk-informed decisions.

The essay emphasizes:

- The importance of shared objectives between security teams and business stakeholders
- Risk-oriented decision making frameworks
- Moving beyond tool-centric security approaches
- Building bridges between technical security and business value
- Creating sustainable security practices that support organizational goals

This piece reflects my experience in bridging the gap between technical security implementation and business strategy, drawing from years of working across different organizational contexts and maturity levels.
