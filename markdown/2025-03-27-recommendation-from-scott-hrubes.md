## Recommendation Details

**From**: Scott Hrubes  
**Position**: Director, Cloud Operations and Software Engineering, Archer Integrated Risk Management  
**Date**: March 27, 2025

## Recommendation Text

"It's rare to find someone who has technical, business, and domain knowledge, and can tailor his communication style and depth to different audiences. Chase can hold meaningful conversations with the most technical engineers in the company and then quickly turn around and explain those concepts to non-technical stakeholders or other business leaders. Chase and I worked together on very complex business and technical problems, which included reshaping how we built, operated, deployed, and secured modern technical services (and how to structure ourselves organizationally to deliver). Chase was always someone I trusted and sought advice and feedback from, and I always felt his feedback was meaningful, precise, and action oriented. I really enjoy working with Chase and hope we have the opportunity to work together again in the future."

## Professional Recognition

This recommendation highlights my ability to bridge technical and business domains while providing actionable guidance across complex organizational challenges.
