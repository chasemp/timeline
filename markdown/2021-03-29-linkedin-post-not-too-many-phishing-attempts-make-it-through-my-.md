Not too many phishing attempts make it through my filters these days, but this one did.  Stealing while posing as Best Buy.  This is appalling and gross.  Be careful out there friends.

The phone # (1-808-913-1496) is a Hawaiian area code, which turns out to be popular with scammers.  The email of 'Geek Squad <1347941057@qq.com>' is for an instant messaging service dominant in China (afaict).

When a user registers for a QQ account they are given a QQ ID number, and this number is also their QQ email address. This ID number can be bound to another email address, so instead of giving someone your actual email, you just give them your QQ number. It’s a nice feature. Unfortunately, it is easy for users to create disposable accounts with QQ and bind them to their real email address. These disposable accounts are commonly used by bots, often created for or by Chinese vendors trying to push their products via spam." 
This is confirmed by looking at information in the email headers: "1347941057@qq.com designates 203.205.251.66 as permitted sender
> Decimal: 3419274050
> Hostname: 
> ASN: 132203
> ISP: Tencent cloud computing
"> Organization: Tencent cloud computing
