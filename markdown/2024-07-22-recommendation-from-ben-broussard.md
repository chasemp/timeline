## Recommendation Details

**From**: Ben Broussard  
**Position**: Principal Consultant, SecureWorks  
**Date**: July 22, 2024

## Recommendation Text

"As a security consultant, I work with many clients who don't know what they want. Working with Chase was different. Not only did Chase understand the environment on an inventory level (what exists), he had an understanding of the threat landscape on a very technical level. Because of this, we were able to achieve a deeper level of testing together, and ultimately uncover things we wouldn't have been able to otherwise (really cool stuff, but obviously I can't describe it more). Working with Chase, it was clear that he had the technical ability to separate what was important from the noise. But what really struck me as a professional consultant, were his communication skills. His communication was not only clear and understandable but had two very important qualities: it was based on doing his research, and it was actionable."

## Professional Recognition

This recommendation from a security consultant highlights my technical depth, threat landscape understanding, and ability to provide actionable, research-based communication.
