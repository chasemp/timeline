This foundational document introduces the OWASP AI Vulnerability Scoring System (AIVSS), a standardized framework for assessing and quantifying security risks in AI systems, with a specific focus on agentic AI architectures. Version 0.5 represents the initial release of our comprehensive scoring methodology.

As a key contributor and reviewer for this document, I helped develop the AIVSS framework that addresses the unique security challenges posed by agentic AI systems. The scoring system provides:

- Standardized vulnerability assessment for AI systems
- Risk quantification methodologies specific to agentic AI
- Framework for evaluating AI security posture
- Guidelines for implementing AI security controls
- Scoring criteria for different types of AI vulnerabilities

This work represents a significant step forward in establishing industry standards for AI security assessment, particularly as organizations increasingly adopt agentic AI technologies that present new attack vectors and security considerations.

The AIVSS framework helps security professionals:
- Assess AI system vulnerabilities consistently
- Prioritize security investments in AI infrastructure
- Communicate AI security risks to stakeholders
- Implement appropriate security controls for AI systems
