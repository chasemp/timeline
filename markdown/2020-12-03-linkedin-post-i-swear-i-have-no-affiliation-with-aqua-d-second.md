I swear I have no affiliation with Aqua :D. Second share of their stuff of the day.  But this is slick and scary.
Aqua’s Team Nautilus has uncovered a container image that, for the first time, allows bad actors to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Kubernetes clusters. The attackers propagate this malware through a Docker Hub lookalike account intended to dupe developers into downloading malicious images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known case where cyber attackers use this method to exploit cloud native stacks by specifically targeting weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters.
