If you stayed late at the DevOpsKC meetup last night you have may have caught me giving this talk about getting a monitoring system going using python from end-to-end. The meet was at offices of codero who were gracious hosts, and the food was provided by Cerner. Thanks again to the folks put this stuff together.
