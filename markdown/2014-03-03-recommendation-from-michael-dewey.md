## Recommendation Details

**From**: Michael Dewey  
**Position**: Principal Software Engineer, deviantART  
**Date**: March 3, 2014

## Recommendation Text

"Chase is honestly one of the nicest people I have had the pleasure to work with. No matter of if we are in a stressful work situation, or discussing life over dinner, I am often struck by what a stand-up guy he is. Chase is an expert in many areas, and you can count on him to explain things in an amazingly direct and clear manner. Many areas of networking that I had always considered to be voids of black magic suddenly made sense when I asked him for an explanation. At the same time, he is always humble and eager to learn more. I would say that he is one of the mature, skilled engineers that should form the foundation of any good engineering team. I only regret that I was not able to work closely with Chase on more projects at deviantART. He will certainly be a great asset wherever he goes."

## Professional Recognition

This early career recommendation highlights my technical expertise, communication skills, and personal character, establishing a foundation for professional recognition.
